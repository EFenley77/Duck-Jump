# Duck-Jump

## Overview
Duck jump was game created using Claude AI. The goal is to get over the blocks and reach the flag at the end!

## Learnings 
I am getting more comfortable using Claude to help me turn my visions into something actionable and into code. I still wish I had more background into the coding and what it all means so I can have more power with editing my progress directly. 

## Tools Used 
Claude AI
